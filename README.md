# IsMyWebsiteUp For Android 4

This is for Android 4 without TLS version 1.2. The original variant has TLS version 1.2 support, but only for Android 5 or more.

Tool to check and make sure your website is up, and alert you whenever it is down.

You can do manual check or create automatic check schedules.

Default configuration will check HTTP status code only, so its data usage is very very low.
